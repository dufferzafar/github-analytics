\section{Dataset}

We're using the dataset from a code hosting website called \href{http://github.com/}{GitHub}.
The dataset is provided by the \href{http://ghtorrent.org/}{GHTorrent} project which montiors the GitHub event stream and stores the data.
We downloaded the \href{http://ghtorrent-downloads.ewi.tudelft.nl/mysql/mysql-2017-09-01.tar.gz}{latest dataset}, which is a 60 GB compressed tarball that contains 20 CSV files, each corresponding to a MySQL table. The details are given in Table 1. When uncompressed, the total size of the dataset is 222 GB of plain text.
