\section{Introduction}

GitHub is a code hosting and collaboration platform for Git repositories
(most of which are source code.) \\

GHTorrent is a mirroring service that monitors the GitHub event stream and
stores the data. Which is then provided for download for research related
activities. \\

In this paper we report various analyses that we performed on the GitHub data.
